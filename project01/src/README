=          Design           =
=============================
Well basically the design was given to us in the JavaDocs so we didn't have to design it by ourselves.


=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
I implemented the library class in a way that you have 2 arrays one for the patrons and the second one
for the books the library hold.
I chose to Implement it that way because in that way I can use the index of the book/patron in the array as
the id.
