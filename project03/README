=============================
SpaceShip.java - The super class of all the other ships.
                 all the different kind of ships inherits from this class.
SpaceShipFactory.java - The space ship factory class.
                        Given the user input before each game
                        representing all the space ships the user wants to play with,
                        This class will generate an array from type - "SpaceShip"
                        with all the spaceship the user chose.
HumanShip.java - Human controlled ship (controlled by the user).
RunnerShip.java - A ship that tries to avoid all other ships.
BasherShip.java - A ship that deliberately tries to collide with other ships.
AggressiveShip.java - A ship that tries to pursue other ships and fire at them.
DrunkardShip.java - A ship with a drunken pilot. (explanation below)
SpecialShip.java - A ship with some interesting behavior (explanation below)

=          Design           =
=============================
I decided to create the different types of spaceships in different classes,
where all the classes inherits from the super class SpaceShip.
more specifically all the methods are implemented in the "SpaceShip" class,
but each spaceship differ in the "doAction()" function where I specifically designed each
"doAction()" function on the each spaceship class.
Furthermore I decided to use "protected" to all the fields in the SpaceShip class
because I wanted to keep them visible for all the space ships which inherits from SpaceShip.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
I implemented the SpaceShipFactory using switch-case syntax.
because we have 6 types of spaceships and I parse the user input using a for-each loop,
so I figured instead of using many if conditions, I'll just use the switch-case method.

another implementation detail worth noting is the implementation of the Drunkard ship and Special ship:
    -Drunkard ship: I obtain a random number ranging from -1 to 1 (integer),
                    this number will choose how the spaceship will turn for the rest of the game.
                    Also I made the spaceship fire all the time so it will look like the pilot doesnt even
                    aim at a specific target which creates the "Drunk" effect (hopefully).
    -Special ship:  I decided to make the special ship undefeatable, which means that it has "god mode"
                    and full energy all the time.
                    also the ship does'nt move which make it like a turret.
